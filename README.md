# Chameleon
Chameleon is an email cloaking service written in Go, and React (TypeScript).

# Current Todos
1. Implement a Mediator pattern between the API handler, and the unit of work
2. Custom IoC implementation (dig doesn't let us change the lifetime) (Unless there is a better solution?)
3. Per-request transactions? 😯


## Maybes
- Custom ORM
  - With blackjack, and hookers
  - Maybe a more strongly-typed query builder?
  - Maybe a strongly typed migrator with rollback capabilities?
